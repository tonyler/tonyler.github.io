								<h3 class="to-animate" style="font-size: 20px;"> This is my first blog, and I couldn't write about anything other 
									than <a href="https://thecybernetics.org/" style="color: orangered;">Cybernetics</a> first. 
									If you've been around Cosmos for a while, and perhaps been a bit more active with Juno, Osmosis, 
									or Chihuahua, you've probably already heard about the Cybernetics Group. I am one of the community managers for Cybernetics, making me probably the best person to learn about Cybernetics from.
									<p></p>
									Cybernetics is a private group of investors focused on Cosmos. While we already exist in other significant 
									ecosystems under other names, the brand "Cybernetics" is dedicated solely to Cosmos. Most of our members come 
									from classical markets backgrounds, meaning that we are not just another VC or private group with
									an expiration date but an experienced group knowledgeable about our goals and what's needed to achieve them.
									<p></p>
									The main objective of Cybernetics within the Cosmos ecosystem is to identify and invest in
									 projects that not only show potential for significant growth but also align with our vision of fostering innovation 
									 and sustainability within the blockchain space. Our ethos and mindset are all about investing in projects with long-term 
									 business plans focusing on generating sustainable passive income.
									We have been angel investors in several projects so far, meaning that we do not invest money to leave 
									the projects for a quick grab; instead, we become part of the project and support it as needed, ensuring its 
									survival during times of crisis.	
									<p></p>								
									Our group consists not only of experienced investors and businessmen but also of some great developers, 
									artists, and a very active community. It's worth mentioning that we have also supported numerous small 
									builders without asking for anything in return. Cosmos will progress as a whole, and we will all rise up 
									together as a united ecosystem.
									<p></p>
									For any proposals to Cybernetics, feel free to DM me. However, make sure that you have a 
									detailed plan in place. My DMs are always open!

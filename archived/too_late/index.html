									At the time of Juno's genesis, it served as the sister hub to the Cosmos Hub. 
									People would launch their dApps on Juno, while the Cosmos Hub operated in a minimal capacity. 
									Juno was touted as the "Ethereum-killer" within the Cosmos Ecosystem, thanks to CosmWasm. 
									Despite Terra and Secret Network already utilizing it for a year, many believed Juno was the next big thing.
									Several promising dApps, such as Loop Protocol, Talis, Junoswap, DA0 DA0, Gelotto, Passage Marketplace, 
									Hot n' Cold, Komple, Hopers, White Whale Dex, Swift Protocol, and more were launched on Juno, with many others in the pipeline. 
									Unfortunately, most of these projects either failed, moved to different ecosystems, or remained incomplete, despite initial funding. 
									Those that persevered struggled to gain the attention they deserved.<p></p><b>Is Juno now dead?</b><p></p>
									<p></p>Unfortunately, Juno faced a significant setback. To make progress, it's essential to break away completely from the old Juno. While the problematic C1 has been disbanded, there are still faults that need to be addressed. For example, there are substantial genesis vested contracts (C-1 members), unclear leadership (hopefully, some will arise from the Charter), and too much unnecessary drama most of the time. Some important known problems that the community has already started solving...This means that Juno is not dead, but it is slowly rising.
									<p></p> <b>What remains now?</b><p></p>Juno possesses a resilient community. Despite other projects having more dApps or funding,
									 none match Juno's community energy. The community independently decided to remove C-1 and adopt a new experimental governance
									  structure called <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyler_/status/1703448644731437261" style="color:#FF7B7C">"The Charter"</a>.
									   The community pool, while not substantial, still exists. While it's now limited, the focus now is on careful spending.
									    It is essential to acknowledge that builders seeking exorbitant amounts for dApp development may not be genuine contributors but 
										rather opportunists. Juno should prioritize funding businesses rather than mere dApps. The emphasis should be on supporting 
										startups in Web3, leveraging Juno's community for visibility,
									 and its advanced technology for creating efficient and secure projects.
									<p></p><b>It's not too late.</b><p></p>Although Juno has lost some of its initial potential and hype, it remains far from dead. The Web3 market is relatively small, and positive developments could propel Juno to new heights. However, acknowledging the need for a fresh restart is crucial for future success.

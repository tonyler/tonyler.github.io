									Juno's lead developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/Reecepbcups_" style="color: coral;">Reece Williams</a>, announced his resignation from his position. 
									His contributions to Juno were immense, and he is a major reason Juno stands as the cutting-edge 
									smart contract platform of the Cosmos ecosystem today. Considered by many as a one-man army, 
									Junonauts looked up to him, feeling confident that their investment in Juno would pay off thanks 
									to his efforts. <p></p>

									<b>However, Reece simply wanted to leave.</b>
									<p></p>
									In the last few months, it became evident that he desired to depart. A series of tweets, messages in Telegram and Discord, and his sale of Juno holdings near its all-time low were more than enough to demonstrate this. While having personal opinions and making predictions about Juno's future is acceptable, the way he expressed these sentiments publicly dealt a blow to people's investments, eroding hope and confidence week by week.
									<p></p>
									<b>Time for a reset.</b>
									<p></p>
									People tend to forget fast, and as the next bull market is about to begin, new investors will enter Juno without full knowledge of its past. On the contrary, missing an excellent developer who occasionally destroys any hype is great news for Juno! Now is the time for Juno to build a robust narrative around its decentralization and significant community contributions.
									<p></p>
									<b>Narrative is everything.</b>
									<p></p>
									Web3 is an immature market, understandable given that it's a new chapter in the history of finance. Currently, every crypto, including Bitcoin, feels like a gamified investment. Many individuals who have never invested in real estate, commodities, or stocks magically own crypto. What adds to this phenomenon is the fact that PFP NFTs with no utility gain significant value, meme coins with no utility gain huge value, and communities conduct research on which meme coin is better to "invest" in. Cardano, during the 2018 bull cycle with absolutely zero smart contracts and only promises, reached over a 1 billion valuation. Terra, with some clear ponzinomics, reached the top 10 in crypto market caps. As you understand, nothing makes sense in Web3. VCs will still pump their bags and manipulate prices, while retailers will ape into narratives, regardless of the technology or utility of a project. Narrative is everything, and Juno has a compelling one that should be seized and leveraged.
									<b>The only truly decentralized, permissionless, governance-oriented layer-1 in the space.</b>
									From a business perspective, having no leaders is disastrous, but in the Web3 space, having no leaders is what truly matters. <p></p>
									
									Does Bitcoin have any leaders after all? <p></p>

									<b>Thanks for everything Reece!</b>

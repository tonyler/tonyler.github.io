									<p></p>
									This guide is designed for TIA stakers (and Cosmos Ecosystem users) who are unsure how to safely bridge ETH to the Ethereum Blockchain and claim their $ALT airdrop. Ethereum fees can be somewhat weird for any Cosmos user, with $15-$20 fees required for claiming, and bridging from chain to chain without IBC can also be costly. However, there's no need to worry. Burning $30 to claim your $ALT airdrop, which is likely worth more than $200, is considered worthwhile. This guide will show you how to claim it in the fastest and most cost-effective way possible.
									<p></p>
									First of all, you'll need to have some ETH on Osmosis. Make sure you have the correct ETH (axlETH) in your wallet, as shown in the image below. Furthermore, ensure you bridge enough fees the first time, so you won't have to bridge and pay fees all over again. An amount of $30 would be a safe amount, so you won't run out of ETH mid-journey. Claiming would require around $17 in fees, and bridging would require approx $6-7 in total (with my guide). A good strategy would be to move an extra $20, so you'll be able to move your ALT tokens once claimed. Now that you've decided the amount to be bridged and acquired your axlETH, let's proceed!

									<p></p>
									If you're using a Ledger device, move all your ETH (and some OSMO for fees) to a non-Ledger device. The platform we will use is currently not functional with Ledger devices, so you won't be able to sign any transactions with it.
									Let's go to <a href="https://app.squidrouter.com/?chains=osmosis-1%2C42161&tokens=ibc%2FEA1D43981D5C9A1C4AAEA9C23BB1D4FA126BA9BC7020A25E0AE4AA841EA25DC5%2C0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE" target="_blank" style="color: greenyellow;">Axelar's Squid</a> and bridge our ETH from Osmosis to Arbitrum. Bridging from Osmosis to Ethereum would require $70, but there's a way to do it for just... $3-4 in the next step! Connect your Cosmos and Ethereum wallets as requested, and bridge all your ETH to Arbitrum, signing any transactions that pop up. The fee for bridging will be something less than $2.5.
									<p></p>

									</div>
									<p></p>
									Now that our ETH is on Arbitrum, let's move them to Ethereum in the cheapest way possible using <a href="https://www.layerswap.io/app" style="color: fuchsia;" target="_blank">Layerswap</a>. Now select the source chain and destination as in the photo below. The source chain must be "Arbitrum One," and the destination should be "Ethereum," making sure you both send and receive "ETH." The fees will be approximately $4-5, and it will take less than 1 minute. Proceed and sign any transactions needed. Use the "Send via wallet" option.									<p></p>
									<div class="image-container">
										<img src="../images/layerswap.png" width="1000" alt="">
									</div>
									<p></p>
									If you're seeing this, your ETH is now on the Ethereum blockchain, and you can now claim your juicy $ALT airdrop!
									<p></p>
									<div class="image-container">

									</div>
									<p></p>
									Now,  you can go <a href="https://airdrop.altlayer.io/" style="color: skyblue;">claim your $ALT</a>. Sign any transactions needed!
									Congratulations! You've claimed your airdrop in less than 10 minutes and paid lower fees than you would have with any other CEX!
